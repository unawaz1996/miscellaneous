# SpliceAI

## What's left to be done:

- [x]  Split a VCF file by samples and put into different directories

- [ ]  Go into these subdirectories and further split by chromosome (an array on Phoenix)

- [ ] Run spliceAI only only files with chr extension (chr means they are split)

- [ ]  Merge all chromosomes together

- [ ]  Merge all samples together 

- [ ] Delete all files created in this pipeline other than the final ones

- [ ]  Compile this into a pipeline (WDL or Snakemake)
