# SpliceAI

## What's left to be done:

* Write a script that is able to split a VCF file by samples and put it into different directories + also put the name of the newly created direcotires in a .txt file

* Write a script that is able to go into these subdirectories and further split by chromosome 

* Write a script that is able to these these split chromosomes in an array on Phoenix (only on the chr extension files)

* Merge all chromosomes together

* Merge all samples together

* Compile this into a pipeline (WDL or Snakemake)
